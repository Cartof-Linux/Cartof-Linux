- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cartof-Linux!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in running ARM Windows on mobile phones having Snapdragon CPUs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding and I am being interested to learn about computer science in order to build steps for the dream of having Windows on newer devices.
- âš¡ Fun fact: In order to make UEFI and drivers for a phone, you need to know this : "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.".
