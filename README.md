- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cartof-Linux!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in running ARM Windows on mobile phones having Snapdragon CPUs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ coding and also everything related to hardware components of a PC.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently working on installing Windows 11 ARM on my Samsung A52s and learn to make drivers for it.
